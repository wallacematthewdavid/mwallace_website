Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Matthew Wallace, and I am a passionate University of Arizona statistics master's graduate with a deep interest in applying statistics to solve real world problems.

-----------------------------------

# My Interests

Statistics & Data Analysis: Since my undergrad, I have been fascinated by the power of data to uncover patterns and tell stories. I've worked on projects ranging from investigating spatial indexing of Arizona wildfires to using Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulations to decipher codes.

Programming: My toolkit includes R, Python, and Quarto, which I have used for data manipulation, visualization, and research.

Teaching: Through my TA and grading experiences, I've guided and assessed students on topics in advanced linear regression while simultaneously depthening my understanding as well.

-----------------------------------

# Current Projects

I have been diving into the intersection of machine learning and statistical analysis. For example, I recently had been working on training neural networks to perform sentiment analysis. Otherwise, my studies have largely focused on the theoretic approach to statistical inference.

-----------------------------------

# Outside Academia

When I'm not immersed in data and code, my enjoyment of rock climbing and studying Japanese serve well to keep me grounded.

# Get in Touch

I'd love to connect! Whether you're interested in collaborating on a project, discussing statistical methods, or just saying hello, feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on LinkedIn.

Thank you for visiting my page!
