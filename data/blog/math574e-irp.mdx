summary: 'An introduction into the functionality of the marmap package in R to access and plot bathymetric data.'

There are a lot of useful R packages that exist for obtaining data and I want to showcase the marmap function for loading in and working with bathymetric data. For those unfamiliar, bathymetric data refers to data on the depth and shape of underwater terain from any body of water. National Centers for Environmental Information (<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/bathymetry/">NOAA</a>) has publicly available bathymetric of the entire world, which we can access using their website directly.

## Plotting

### Base R

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap">
  <div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden">
    ![NOAA Landing Page](/static/images/math574e-irp/NOAA.png)
  </div>
</div>

Alternatively, we could very easily pull this same data from the `getNOAA.bathy` function from the marmap R package directly into R.

```r
library(marmap)
# Define bounds for bathymetric data
gulf.lon1 = -70
gulf.lon2 = -110
gulf.lat1 = 35
gulf.lat2 = 15
gulf.bathy <- getNOAA.bathy(gulf.lon1, gulf.lon2, gulf.lat1, gulf.lat2,
                            resolution=10)
plot.bathy(gulf.bathy)
```

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap">
  <div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden">
    ![Base NOAA Plot](/static/images/math574e-irp/NOAA_plot1.png)
  </div>
</div>

This plot is quite lacking and there is a lot we can do with these with not much effort. Setting `image` and `land` to True and adding `scaleBathy` colors our land and water in out plot and provides a scale for the size of the map.

```{r}
plot.bathy(gulf.bathy, 
     image=T, 
     land=T, 
     axes=F,)
axis(1, at=seq(gulf.lon1, gulf.lon2, by = -5))
axis(2, at=seq(gulf.lat1, gulf.lat2, by = -5))
scaleBathy(gulf.bathy,deg=4.28,x=-95,y=33)
```

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap">
  <div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden">
    ![NOAA Plot 2](/static/images/math574e-irp/NOAA_plot2.png)
  </div>
</div>

These colors that we gave to the land and water are completely customizeable, however. Though, the way we must chose these colors can be a bit confusing.

```{r}
land <- c(grey(0.7),grey(0.9),grey(1))
water <- c("red","orange","yellow")
plot.bathy(gulf.bathy, 
     image=T, 
     land=T, 
     axes=F,
     bpal=list(c(0,max(gulf.bathy),land), c(min(gulf.bathy),0,water)))
axis(1, at=seq(gulf.lon1, gulf.lon2, by = -5))
axis(2, at=seq(gulf.lat1, gulf.lat2, by = -5))
scaleBathy(gulf.bathy,deg=4.28,x=-95,y=33)
```
<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap">
  <div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden">
    ![NOAA Plot 3](/static/images/math574e-irp/NOAA_plot3.png)
  </div>
</div>

### GGPlot

These plots so far have been using base R for the plots, but there is also integration with ggplot from this package through the `autoplot.bathy` function.

```{r}
autoplot.bathy(gulf.bathy)
```

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden">
![NOAA GGPlot 1](/static/images/math574e-irp/NOAA_ggplot1.png)
</div>

There is a lot of customization that can be done with these autoplots, but I will just showcase a very simple function, `scale_fill_etopo`, which very simply makes the entire plot look very easy to read with a color palette that we are used to see for maps of the world.

```{r}
autoplot.bathy(gulf.bathy, geom=c("r","c")) + 
  scale_fill_etopo(name="Depth (m)") +
  xlab("Longitude") + 
  ylab("Latitude")
```

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden">
![NOAA GGPlot 2](/static/images/math574e-irp/NOAA_ggplot2.png)
</div>

## Transects

The last thing I would like to showcase with this blog post is the ability to get transects of the water using different points. I could pick any two points and the line between them, like what's shown below.

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden">
![NOAA Plot 4](/static/images/math574e-irp/NOAA_plot4.png)
</div>

Using this package, the `get.transect` function gets the data for the transect and a simple `plot` function will plot the transect.

```{r}
x1 <- -87.13
y1 <- 21.21
x2 <- -81.05
y2 <- 25.32

gulf.tr <- get.transect(gulf.bathy,x1=x1,y1=y1,x2=x2,y2=y2,distance=T)
plotProfile(gulf.tr)
```

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden">
![NOAA Plot 5](/static/images/math574e-irp/NOAA_plot5.png)
</div>

There are a lot more applications for this package, but the intention of this blog is to overview what can be done with the package so if these functions would lend value, their existence would be known.
